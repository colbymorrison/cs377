Bear and the Honeybees. I.e. producer-consumer with multiple producers and one consumer.
Solution with split binary semaphores:

int portions = 0;
sem empty = 1, pot = 0;

process Bear{
    while(true){
        sleep();
        wait(pot);
        portions = 0; // eats all the honey
        signal(empty);
    }
} 


process Bee[i = 1 to n]{
    while(true){
        wait(empty);
        portions++;
        if(portions == H)
            signal(pot); // Passing the baton (let bear signal empty)
                         // The bear only gets signaled when the pot is full, so it doesn't have to check the condition itself and possibly busy wait
        else
            signal(empty);
    }
}
