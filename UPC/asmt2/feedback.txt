This assignment was fun! I think UPC is really cool, it's fun to see my programs run across the network.
I didn't find the problems too hard, the temperature examples were helpful in using the new syntax. Compiler errors were helpful as well. For example, I learned that shared variables must be static and not automatic.
It was interesting that the second problem using the "improved for loop"  was faster than the first 
problem, even when both were compiled with upcc with one thread and then run with upcrun. I'm curious what optimizations happened to create that performance improvement.
I'm excited to learn more about UPC and to use all the different types of pointers!
