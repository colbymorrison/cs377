These programs were very simple for me, especially after Operating Systems last semester which conlcued with a substantial project in C. I feel comfortable with all the concepts used, such as  pointers, arrays, and dynamic memory, along with the general features of C. I use vim regularly in my everyday comuting, so I had no issue using it here. Looking forward to more programming assignments.
